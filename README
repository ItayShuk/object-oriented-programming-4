SimpleSet  - parent class to sets

OpenHashSet - Set that relays on Wrapper, doing it by linked lists

Wrapper - Creating linked lists and connecting them

ClosedHashSet - Set that relays on string list

CollectionFacadeSet - Implement SimpleSet functions to other java sets

SimpleSetPerformanceAnalyzer - Analyzing and comparing different sets in java by
the time it takes to complete tests

=============================

Ive added wrapper class in order to store linked lists

Ive created list of Sets in the Analyzer class,
using iteration between sets while tests their time.

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================

*   Open - Ive created Class to wrap all linked lists, so ive created
    list of linked list containing strings.
    When resize is chosen, I copied the table and added
    the elements to the new copy.

********************

*   Close - Marked the deleted cell with String called FLAG, so that
    I know by comparing object if my FLAG is there or not.

=============================

1)

*   Open - Adding takes time because lot of String got the same HashCode
    which results with one big linked list.

*   Close - Adding takes time to find the right index for adding which is
    available, also contains runs on O(n), checking the whole list
    to make sure its not in it already.

********************
2)

*   Open - Takes time to add when its the same hash,
    when its not the same hash its consider quick,
    the contains option is efficient as long as the hashcode is different
    from others.

*   Close - Takes tons of time to add while items with same hash,
    if not its consider quick,
    the contains option is efficient as long as the hashcode is different
    from others.

*   Tree - Not so efficient while checking if contain regular search value
    Will chose it if I want to sort the data structure.

*   Linked - Not good at checking if value is in the set,
    used it to add values as long as its not a set.

*   HashSet - Efficient in all aspects.
    But gives no information about where the strings are.

*******************
3)

*   Takes O(n^2) with the closed set to resize itself while open is quicker,


*******************
4)

*   HashSet is adding values much better then Open and Close at same hash condition.
